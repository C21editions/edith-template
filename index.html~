        <p>The aim of Edith is to provide an easy-to-use and sustainable template for digital editions. Easy-to-use means anybody can copy or download this repository, change a few files and links and have their own digital edition. Basic knowledge of HTML will be enough to get started. Sustainable means the edition is a flat-file system and does not rely on complex-to-maintain frameworks. All that is is needed is a HTML5 browser and client-side JavaScript. Because of this simplicity, the edition can be hosted free of cost here on GitHub, or on any other web hosting provider with minimal system requirements. The edition is also sustainable in that it is easy to archive (simply download all files in this repository) and reproduce.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/mkrzmr/town">digital edition of <i>Town</i></a> was realized using the same template.</p>
        <p>The digital edition uses <a href="https://c21editions.github.io/edith/" target="_blank">Edith, a template for minimal editions</a>, created by the <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/projects/c21editions/" target="_blank">C21 Editions project</a>, jointly funded by the Irish Research Council and UKRI-AHRC (grant numbers IRC/W001489/1 and AH/W001489/1).</p>

        <p>Edith is inspired by <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/" target="_blank">Ed</a>.</p>
